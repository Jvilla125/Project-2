# Travel App Tracker

Welcome to the _Travel App Tracker_, an application that allows you to keep track of all the trips that you may have taken over the years. As the user, you're able to upload details (Country, City, dates, and a brief description), images, and track your costs. 

# Screenshots of the App

* Once they are done, they will be redirected to view their personal trip. If the user makes a mistake, there is an `edit` button where they can fix any errors.

* At the bottom of the user's personal trip, there is an option to upload and render images. There is a step-by-step instruction for the user to follow.

* After a user uploads an image, the step-by-step instructions will disappear and allow the user to upload more than one images. If the user decides to delete all images, the step-by-step instructions will reappear. 

# Wireframing
I used `Whimisical` to help plan out the models and stucture of the application. In the planning phase, listing out the needed modelSchema's made it easier to understand the users needs for the application.

# Next Steps

On the next version of this application, I am planning on incorpating the following features:
1. Rearranging the home page, welcome page, and view trips page.
2. Include accessibility to the application on mobile devices. 
3. Allow the user to upload directly on their trip page.
4. Incorporate an interactive map where the user can drop a pinpoint to where they took their trip.
5. Update the budget tracker table to have activity options for the user to choose from.
6. Give Users access to view other User's trips.
